In order to extract the fundamental physics from high-energy collision experiments, it is necessary to rely on precise theoretical predictions. Computational tools are consequential in obtaining such predictions. Hence this dissertation heavily relies on standard tools in high-energy physics for performing the phenomenological study of leptoquark production at the LHC. The first step in this process was implementing the theoretical model with its parameters using Mathematica's FeynRules package \cite{alloul_FeynRules_2014}. In this case, instead of implementing the model independently, the Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) file developed and made available by the authors of \cite{baker_high_2019} was used. The UFO file was then passed on to MadGraph. This piece of software calculates matrix elements at NLO \cite{automated-alwall-2014, MadGraph5}. MadGraph includes a MC event generator, MadEvent, which uses the amplitudes generated by MadGraph to calculate cross-sections and to obtain unweighted processes. Once the events are generated, they are passed to Pythia, a MC shower generator, that perturbatively evolves the partons through the emission of QCD radiation and eventually turns them into physical states \cite{sjostrand_pythia_2006}. This process is known as hadronisation. In order to simulate the detector response, the Delphes software will be used \cite{de_favereau_delphes_2014}. This software includes aspects of the experimental setup such as detector resolution and misidentification rates. The final stage of the analysis is done in ROOT, software developed by CERN for the statistical analysis of scientific data \cite{antcheva-ROOT-2009}.
